# Graph_Matching_Network-Pytorch
Pytorch implementation of Graph Matching Networks published in **[ICML 2019](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/li19d/li19d.pdf)**

## Requirements
Pytorch >=1.6
CUDA >= 9.1
networkx >= 2.3
torch-sparse==0.6.7 (pip install torch-sparse)
torch-cluster==1.4.5 (pip install torch-cluster)
torch-geometric==1.3.2 (pip install torch-geometric)


## Usage
The code is split in sub-modules for a cleanr understanding.
The naming of each of the files is self-explanatory.

## Credits
This Pytroch implementation of the code has been built on top of the Tensorflow **[Colab implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/deepmind_research/blob/master/graph_matching_networks/graph_matching_networks.ipynb)** by DeepMind Research.
